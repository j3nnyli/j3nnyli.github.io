All first-year students at Georgia Tech, regardless of major, must take an introductory English course that is crafted around a foundation known as WOVEN. Each letter represents a mode of communication emphasized by the curriculum: W for written, O for oral, V for visual, E for electronic, and N for nonverbal. English at Georgia Tech is rather unique because each professor gets to choose something specific that they will center their teaching of WOVEN around; this could be anything from sci-fi video games to Southern Gothic literature. I took a course centered around the evolution of films, directors, and cinematography through the Golden Age of Film to the present day.

This is my end-of-course portfolio - a showcase, in lieu of a typical final exam, displaying smaller projects done throughout the course that each focused on different areas of WOVEN.
