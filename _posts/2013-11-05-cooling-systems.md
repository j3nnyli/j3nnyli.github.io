In late 2013, my junior year of high school, Elon Musk's revolutionary idea for a transportation system – the Hyperloop – was popping up in the news everywhere. I read through the Hyperloop blueprint and was intrigued by the section explaining how the transport capsule's cooling system would theoretically function. This project was an attempt to identify potential issues with the design in the blueprint and with such systems in frictionless vehicles in general, and to redesign the proposed cooling system with fluids, thermodynamics, efficiency, cost, and feasibility in mind. 

Over the period of 2 weeks, I was able to teach myself enough about how to work with CAD and CFD simulation software to experiment with models of systems I had created, and taught myself various fluids and thermodynamics concepts in order to better research the project. 

This project was originally completed for my high school's science fair, where it won first place. It was entered into the 2014 Gwinnett County Regional Science and Engineering Fair in the Engineering: Materials and Bioengineering category, and won first place there. Additionally, I received the Yale Science & Engineering Association Science Fair Award for the best overall project, across all categories, completed and presented by a junior.

It went on to compete at the 2014 Georgia Science and Engineering Fair in Athens, Georgia.
