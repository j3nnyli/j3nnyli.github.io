Recent statistics and data show that Miami, Florida, is host to an explosion of startup establishment and activity, with even greater numbers than those of the New England area and Silicon Valley. Miami is clearly a hotbed for startups – but then why is it not known as one of America's great innovation hubs? This presentation seeks answers to this question by breaking down potential factors and relating them to concepts of urban economics. The connections between entrepreneurship and urban economics are very obviously present but have not yet been studied; little research has been done.

The research idea and presentation was completed as part of ECON 4421, “Urban and Regional Economics.”
