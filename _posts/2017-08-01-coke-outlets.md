As an intern at The Coca-Cola Company in the Revenue Growth Management department, I collaborated with two other RGM interns, Christina Fleischer and Benedict Wong, to solve this business problem.

Targeting the teen/young adult demographic is essential for the continued growth of a beverage business. Our goal was to identify growth opportunities geographically for this demographic.

We received raw data in the form of population numbers and were able to segment and bucket it. We derived population percentages and used trade areas to further drill down into our data. From here, we built a tool in Excel that would allow a user to paste in raw data and generate a pivot table-ready report. Users could view this report by customer, by package, by bottler, by city, by store, and a number of other useful filters. This report was also ready for use within Tableau.

Our methodology and the tools we developed to execute it will provide insights and influence marketing, financial, and supply chain strategy. It is useful not only for the Revenue Growth Management teams, but also for various customer and bottler teams as well as shopper and brand promotion strategy.

With our system, we can now produce store lists, maps, and product rankings for both bottlers and customers, which will enable them to more efficiently target the critical teen and young adult shopper in their specific stores and geographies.
