<i>Buried deep within you, beneath all the years of pain and anger, there is something that has never been nurtured: the potential to make yourself a better man. And that is what it is to be human. To make yourself more than you are. Oh, yes — I know you. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.</i>

<b>Hello world!</b> I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate at Georgia Tech. My family is originally from Xiamen, China, and I'm native to Atlanta, Georgia. I'm majoring in Industrial Engineering with a concentration in Economic and Financial Systems, and I'm also obtaining a minor in Economics.


I have always sought opportunities to develop my professional and technical skills in a challenging and competitive environment. To this end, I've completed two rotations as a Revenue Growth Management Co-op at The Coca-Cola Company's Atlanta headquarters; at Georgia Tech, I was the President of the Epsilon Theta Chapter of Phi Sigma Pi, as well as the co-founder and Vice President of our Young Americans for Liberty chapter. Additionally, I'm involved with the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers chapter here, and I was a Campus Ambassador with the Foundation for Economic Education.


After graduation, I'll be working as a Staff Consultant with EY as part of their Technology Advisor Program.


I've had a long-held fascination with astronomy, space exploration, and history, and I'm a member of STARFLEET International, although I grew up obsessed with Star Wars. When I have free time, I'm golfing, playing the violin or chess, browsing r/daystrominstitute, or on Steam. I hope one day to visit and explore space.
